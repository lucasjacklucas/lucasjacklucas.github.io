Thanks for visiting this site. I am a Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Calgary. My research and teaching are in the area of Canadian politics, with a particular focus on municipal elections and representation, ideology and political representation in municipal politics, and urban-rural political divides. I am also interested in “implicit” or “lay” theories of politics, especially among political elites.

## Current Projects

My main active research project is the [Canadian Municipal Barometer](http://www.cmb-bmc.ca), for which I serve as project co-director with Sandra Breux (INRS). The Canadian Municipal Barometer is a large research partnership focused on municipal democracy and representation, with a particular emphasis on diverse representation (led by Erin Tolley), elections and voting (led by Michael McGregor), multilevel governance (led by Kristin Good), and public policy (led by Martin Horak). Since 2020, the Canadian Municipal Barometer has surveyed elected mayors and councillors in Canada's 450 largest municipalities; beginning in early 2025, our work will expand to include surveys of mayors and councillors in Canada's 1,000 largest municipalities, annual public opinion surveys across Canada, qualitative research, and municipal election studies. The Canadian Municipal Barometer is supported by a SSHRC Partnership Grant (2024-2031).  

I am also Canadian co-PI, with Peter Loewen, of the Canadian chapter of [POLPOP-II](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/m2p/polpop/polpop_2/), a comparative survey of national and regional politicians in thirteen countries. In 2022, the POLPOP-II team completed face-to-face interviews with more than 1,000 politicians, with an additional round of data collection planned for 2025. POLPOP-II is led by Stefaan Walgrave (University of Antwerp) and is supported by a European Research Council Advanced Grant (Stefaan Walgrave, PI).
