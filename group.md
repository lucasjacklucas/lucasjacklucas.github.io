Thanks for visiting this site. I am a Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Calgary. My research and teaching are in the area of Canadian politics, with a particular focus on municipal democracy and representation, ideology in local and urban politics, and urban-rural divides. I am also interested in "implicit" or "lay" theories of politics, especially among political elites. You can email me [here](mailto:jack.lucas@ucalgary.ca).
