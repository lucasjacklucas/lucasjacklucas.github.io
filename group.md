My research group is broadly focused on democracy and political representation in Canada, with a particular emphasis on local and urban politics. We meet regularly to share ideas, discuss new research, plan research projects, and provide feedback. The research group is based at the University of Calgary but includes members from across Canada. If you have an interest in joining the research group, please get in touch!
