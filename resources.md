## Canadian Municipal Barometer

## Canadian Voting and Policy Attitudes

Researchers who are interested in policy attitudes and voting may also be interested in latent unidimensional ideology estimates created with Dave Armstrong; the individual-level ideology scores, together with MRP estimates of average ideological positions for municipalities and federal electoral districts in Canada, are available [at this page](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP2/BLYP7X).

## Cities in Canadian Political Development

## Other Resources

Miscellaneous additional resources are available on my [Dataverse](https://borealisdata.ca/dataverse/jacklucas). I have also written an R package to easily estimate Bayesian factor analysis models and produce useful summary statistics; it is available [here](https://github.com/lucasjacklucas/lucasjacklucas), and I'm happy to explain how to use the package to anyone who would like to use it, but it is (and is likely to remain) completely undocumented and unsupported so...buyer beware!
