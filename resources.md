## Canadian Municipal Barometer

The Canadian Municipal Barometer dataverse is available here. The Canadian Municipal Elections Database, containing more than 40,000 distinct municipal election contests in Canada, is available here. Our database on women's representation, constructed in collaboration with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, is available here. Please note that the Canadian Municipal Barometer is in a period of transition as we expand our team and scope; researchers who are interested in specific data should contact me directly until we have constructed our new consolidated data repository. 

## Canadian Voting and Policy Attitudes

The CVAP R package is available [here](https://github.com/davidaarmstrong/cvpa). The interactive shiny app is available [here](https://quantoid.shinyapps.io/cvpa_app/). Raw data for the first phase of the project (vote intention and demographic variables) will be available at the Canadian Opinion Research Archive in the coming months; in the meantime, please contact me for access. 

Researchers who are interested in policy attitudes and voting may also be interested in latent unidimensional ideology estimates created with Dave Armstrong; the individual-level ideology scores, together with MRP estimates of average ideological positions for municipalities and federal electoral districts in Canada, are available [at this page](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP2/BLYP7X).

## Other Resources

Miscellaneous additional resources are available on my [Dataverse](https://borealisdata.ca/dataverse/jacklucas). I have also written an R package to easily estimate Bayesian factor analysis models and produce useful summary statistics; it is available [here](https://github.com/lucasjacklucas/lucasjacklucas), and I'm happy to explain how to use the package to anyone who would like to use it, but it is (and is likely to remain) completely undocumented and unsupported so...buyer beware!
