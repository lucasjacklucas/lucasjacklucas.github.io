## Canadian Municipal Barometer

## Canadian Voting and Policy Attitudes

## Cities in Canadian Political Development

## Other Resources

Miscellaneous additional resources are available on my Borealis site (i.e. Dataverse). I have also written an R package to easily estimate Bayesian factor analysis models and produce useful summary statistics; it is available [here](https://github.com/lucasjacklucas/lucasjacklucas), and I'm happy to explain how to use the package to anyone who would like to use it, but it is (and is likely to remain) completely undocumented and unsupported so...buyer beware!
